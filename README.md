**A web application that displays random quotes to motivate, inspire, entertain and educate users.**

*I designed and implemented it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.*

What I particularly love about this project is the ability to utilize data structures such as arrays and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).
The convenience of being able to easily access motivating quotes whenever I want is what makes this project so enjoyable. 

One improvement I would like to make in the future is to consume APIs that already have a variety of quotes, instead of collecting and storing them in an array, as this would be more time-efficient."
